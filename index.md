I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science,
University of Milano-Bicocca. My research interests are in the field
of algorithms and complexity theory. I am particularly interested in
some problems in Computational Biology, such as the Multiple Sequence
Alignment, Phylogeny Reconstruction, 
and Gene Structure Inference. I am a member of
[BIAS](http://algolab.eu/), a research
group on Bionformatics and Experimental Algorithmics.


## Research

I have made available a preprint of my recent papers at
[ArXiv](http://arxiv.org/a/dellavedova_g_1), and I plan to do so for
the foreseeable future.

Almost all my papers are indexed at the wonderful
[DBLP](http://dblp.org/pers/hc/v/Vedova:Gianluca_Della.html).

A list of my publications is also at
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0gaIFokAAAAJ)
and at
[BOA](https://boa.unimib.it/browse?type=author&amp;authority=rp06846)
(Bicocca Open Archive): the institutional achive of my university.


My ORCID is
[0000-0001-5584-3089](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5584-3089)
