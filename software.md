## Highlights

[cppp](https://github.com/AlgoLab/cppp): a program to compute the
Constrained Persistent Phylogeny

[PIntron](http://PIntron.algolab.eu/): A novel pipeline for
gene-structure prediction based on spliced alignment of transcript
sequences (ESTs and mRNAs) against a genomic sequence.

[reduceLCS](https://github.com/gdv/Reduce-Expand-for-LCS): a fast
program to compute the approximate Longest Commons Subsequence of a
set of strings.

[SASC](https://github.com/sciccolella/sasc/): a fast and precise tool for cancer
progression inference from single-cell data.

[ASGAL](https://asgal.algolab.eu/): a tool to discover new alternative splicing events
